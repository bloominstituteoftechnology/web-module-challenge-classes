## Instructions

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks until all of your tests pass. You can use yesterday's work to help you.

If you run into trouble while coding, fight the good fight for 20 minutes and then get on the help channel. __Remember to formulate your help request in a professional manner__ - like you would at work - by including error messages, screenshots, and any other pertinent information about the problem, as well as what kinds of things you tried already while attempting to solve it.

1. Install dependencies by `npm install`.
