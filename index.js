  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane class whose constructor initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` property of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property gets set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property gets set to false.

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person class whose constructor initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should also initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 2
    - Write a Car class whose constructor initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with a `tank` at 0

    - A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:

  TASK 3

    - Its constructor should initialize `name`, `age` and `location` properties on the instance.

  TASK 4
    - Write an Instructor class extending Lambdasian.
    - Its constructor takes a single argument - an object with the following keys:

        + `demo` receives a `subject` string as an argument and returns the phrase 'Today we are learning about {subject}' where subject is the param passed in.
        + `grade` receives a `student` object and a `subject` string as arguments and returns '{student.name} receives a perfect score on {subject}'

        + `PRAssignment` a method that receives a subject as an argument and returns `student.name has submitted a PR for {subject}`
